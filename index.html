		<h2>Welcome</h2>

		<h2>About us</h2>
		<p>
			The Wiltshire Mammal Group was formed in 2005 by Mark Satinet (then Water Vole Recovery Project Officer, Wiltshire Wildlife Trust) and Hannah Price (then Species Data Officer, WSBRC) with support from other key county mammal experts.
		</p>
		<p>
			The primary purpose of the group was to improve mammal recording across Wiltshire, with a particular focus upon Dormice in the early years.
		</p>
		<p>
			The Chair of the group is Mark Satinet and he is supported by an informal committee with secretariat provided by the WSBRC. The group presently has a small membership but also has around 75 individuals currently on its mailing list who are kept informed of the groups' activities.</p>
		</p>					

		<h2>Aims of the group</h2>
		<p>
			The keys aims of the group are:
			<ul>
				<li>To promote the study and conservation of Wiltshire's mammals;</li>
				<li>To establish a coordinated and systematic mammal recording and monitoring network in Wiltshire.</li>
			</ul>
		</p>
		<p>
			The group relies on volunteers throughout the county to help organise events, carry out monitoring and survey work and send in their mammal records.
