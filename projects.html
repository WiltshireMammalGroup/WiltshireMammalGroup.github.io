h3. Wiltshire's Mammal Atlas Project

In 2013 the Mammal Society launched its national mammal atlas project to publish an update of the current known distribution of the UK's mammals. Such a publication requires data from national and local recording schemes and will as such be drawing upon national recording schemes such as the PTES' National Dormouse Monitoring Programme.

There is a clear role for local recording groups in each county to contribute to this project and consequently the Mammal Society is asking for local mammal groups and other schemes and societies to tackle the issue of under-recording and lack of monitoring of mammals and its knock-on effects on mammal conservation. To find out more take a look at the <a href="http://www.mammal.org.uk/">Mammal Society's website</a>.

The Wiltshire Mammal Group has decided to promote the recording and monitoring of mammals in order to contribute data to the national atlas project, and publish an updated county mammal atlas.

h2. Joint Surveys

h3. Dormice Monitoring Sites

Four sites, spread across the county, are currently monitored in the county for the National Dormouse Monitoring Programme (for example, in the Savernake Forest). Additional sites are also monitored using boxes feeding data into reserve management plans. Members of the group take part in this monitoring at sites at Savernake Forest, North Wraxell, Shaftesbury and Stanton Park.
