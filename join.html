h2. Membership

Membership of the group costs &#163;10 per year via a standing order (for ease of administration). To support the work of the group by becoming a member email the group and we will send you a standing order form to fill in and send to your bank. We will then put you on the mailing list as a member, giving alerts to training events, activities and surveys. 

h2. Meetings

The group meet two to four times a year at the Wiltshire Wildlife Trust's head offices in Devizes. If you would like to come along and find out more about what we are up to then please contact us.
