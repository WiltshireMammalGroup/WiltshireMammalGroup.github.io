h2. Introduction

Please send in your mammal sightings. If you have made records of mammals in Wiltshire and Swindon we'd love to hear from you!

By recording your sightings it helps to build up a better picture of the present distribution of mammals and changes in their       population across the whole county. To do this it relies upon everyone and anyone submitting their records.

Wiltshire Mammal Group encourages everyone to submit their records online using Living Record. However records can be submitted using the <a href="http://www.wsbrc.org.uk/YourRecords/recordingform/Survey.aspx">WSBRC online recording form</a> or using the <a href="http://www.wsbrc.org.uk/images/2013/4/WSBRCBasicDataE.xlsx">standard electronic form</a>. All records will be checked and collated before being sent to the County Mammal Recorder for verifying.
